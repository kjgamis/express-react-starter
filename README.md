# Express + React Starter

## Scripts

### Download all dependencies

```
npm install
```

### Run the app locally

```
npm start
```
This will start the express server and serve compiled react scripts that were generated on the `build` folder.

The react app can be run for development purposes using a different script:

```
npm run development
# OR
npm run dev
```
To see changes from the react front-end to the server, the build script must be run first.

```
npm run build
```
